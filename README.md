Recipes Website for The Odin Project

This project is for the first project for The Odin Project.  I will be creating a recipe website that first just uses HTML, but then adds CSS and eventually JavaScript.

The recipes on this website will be separated into the different meals, each recipe should have an image with it, and should have detailed cooking instructions.
