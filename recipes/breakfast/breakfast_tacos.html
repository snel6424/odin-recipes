    <h3>What are Breakfast Tacos?</h3>
    <p>Breakfast tacos are generally tacos one would eat for breakfast, though they can be consumed at any time of the day. 
        Commonly, these tacos would contain scrambled eggs, which is a common breakfast staple worldwide. 
        Though the origin of the breakfast taco is unknown, they are found regularly near the U.S./Mexico border.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bacon</strong>: For the most delicious, savory breakfast crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Soft, pillowy scrambled eggs are the best.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Adds a pop of fresh flavor with every bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Avocado</strong>: Creamy avocado is always welcome at the breakfast table.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: I'm using shredded cheddar, but feel free to use whatever you have on hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs</strong>: Fresh cilantro is always my go-to.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortilla</strong>: I love to make my cassava flour tortillas, but any kind of tortilla will work!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Making breakfast tacos is quick and easy! </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon. Bake your strips in the oven for 18-20 minutes, then let them dry on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Saute the green onions. Give the white parts of the green onion a quick saut√© with olive oil.</li>
        <li>In goes the eggs. Whisk the eggs and pour it into the pan. Gently stir the eggs as they cook to create the perfect pillowy texture.</li>
        <li>Time to assemble! Add a good spoonful or two of scrambled eggs to a tortilla. Top it off with green onion, crumbled bacon, diced avocado, cheese, cilantro, and a dash of salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Warmed up tortillas are a must for any taco! Gently heat them in a pan or over a gas flame for browned edges.</p>
